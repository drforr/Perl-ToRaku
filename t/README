Test README

The directory is named the way it is because of prove(1)'s defaults.
It doesn't recurse through directories by default, and I'm always
(well, occasionally) forgetting to add the '-r' flag to run my full
test suites. So to KISS I'm going to put all of the tests for core stuff
in the top-level directory.

You'll note as well I'm not using the convention of naming the
Transformers:: tests DDD-$name.t. I'm not doing this because eventually
if I number the things, I'll either not like where they are run or
what order they're run in, so I'll just keep the numbers off all the
t/$Transformer::Name.t tests. It means they'll run at the end, but
all of the core tests *should* be run anyway...

Something else to point out is that because of the way PPI operates, I can
get away with writing each test "only" twice - once with abolutely no
whitespace between tokens, and once with whitespace between every possible
token.

This is mainly to make sure that I don't accidentally use the
'sprevious_sibling' version of a method call when I meant 'previous_sibling'.
One version treats whitespace as significant, and the other version doesn't.
And I don't want to worry about which means which.
